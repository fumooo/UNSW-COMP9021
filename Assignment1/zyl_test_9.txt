Yesterday, I was playing League of Legends. 
Sir Darius said: "I am a Knight."
Sir Lee helped Sir Darius get first blood. 
Sir Garen said: "Sir Darius or Sir Lee is a Knave!"
Sir Jinx got unhappy at the bot lane: "exactly one of Sir Garen, Sir Darius
 and Sir Riven is a Knave!"
Sir Lee added: "At least one of us is a Knight."
Sir Riven won lane , 
so he was happy and said, "Sir Garen is a Knight."
What do you think?
